# This test exercises the RPC retrieval of ports with security groups.
#
# This test depends on a custom class in the neutron rally-scenarios
# plugins directory. To use it locally, the rpc.py plugin will
# need to be copied to /etc/rally/plugins/scenarios or
# ~/.rally/plugins/scenarios as specified in
# http://rally.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html#scenarios-plugins
#
# This scenario test is kind of funky right now because it requires partial
# neutron configuration to work and oslo.cfg doesn't support the rally process
# having it's own config and parsing the neutron.conf config. So for now,
# the rabbit details for RPC need to be explicitly set here.
